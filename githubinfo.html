		<p>All About GitHub<br>
            Q. What is a version control system?<br>
            A. Version control system is a system that regularly records and logs the changes that have been made to 
            files and folders over a period of time, so that intermediary versions may be recovered at a later period in time.<br><br>
            Q. What is Git?<br>
            A. Git is a type of distributed version control system (VCS) that works differently from other such systems, in that it records the state of all 
            files given a commit, and then retroactively determines whether changes to files have warranted a version change. <br><br>
            Q. What is GitHub?<br>
            A. GitHub is the largest online platform dedicated to hosting Git repositories, with millions of users collaboratively contributing to projects and developers.<br><br>
            Q. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?<br>
            A. GitHub is the largest web provider of Git repositories. While Git is a command-line tool, GitHub functions as a GUI for the manipulation of Gits.<br><br>
            Q. Who started Github and how was it started?<br>
            A. GitHub was created by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon in 2008, after registering their company in San Francisco, CA in 2007.<br><br>
            Q. What company owns it now?<br>
            A. GitHub was acquired by the Microsoft Corporation in 2018 for $7.5 billion in stock. Over the past five years, 
            GitHub has remained largely independent of Microsoft as a subsidiary, similar to the LinkedIn Corporation.<br><br>
            Q. How much does a GitHub account cost?<br>

            Git/GitHub terms:<br><br>
            repository - these are GitHub's versions of folders and contain all of the project's files and revision histories.<br>
            commit - To commit is Git nomenclature for saving files after they have been altered, which records the changes themselves, their chronology, and authorship<br>
            fork - A fork is an independent copy of a Git repository that clones the code and settings of its "parent" repository.<br>
            push - As converse of the command "fetch", it transfers commits from a local repository to a remote one.<br>
            pull requests - Pull requests are mechanisms by which collaborators can notify each other about changes to code, so that these can be further scrutinized and expanded on<br>
            workflows - In Git, workflows are defined as automated processes that execute actions or "jobs" and can be triggered in a variety of ways.<br>
            issues - GitHub issues presents a way to track bugs and request features via a tracking system integrated into the GitHub service.<br>
            raw button - In GitHub. the raw button renders raw view, which can open a file it its raw form, meaning that all formatting is removed.<br>
            blame button - The GitHub blame button executes the Git blame command, which is used to determine which previous commit resulted in their corresponding alterations to a file.<br>
