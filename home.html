        <h2>What is the United States Code?</h2>
        <p>The United States Code is a a comprehensive collection of U.S. Federal Statutes. 
            It was first published in 1926, then again in '34, and then every six years henceforth. It is categorized into 54 general titles according to a wide-ranging subject matter. 
            The law contained in the Code is the sum of over 200 years of the American legislature process. 
            Though only published in cycles by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives, it is updated constantly. 
            It does not contain all of the United States Federal laws, but rather general and permanent laws, as opposed to temporary and special laws. 
            If you want to search for a specific act within the title, and know its name, you can use the <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/popularnames/popularnames.htm">Popular Names Table</a> 
            of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel's USC webpage. It might take a moment to load. And while the name Office of the Law Revision Counsel might seem to indicate that it is willing to answer questions about the US Code 
            or perhaps even provide legal advice to the general public, it does not. Instead, should you have a comment about a specific piece of legislation, it is advised that these be sent to your respective 
            Representative in the <a href="https://www.house.gov/">House</a> or <a href="https://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a>.

        </p>
        <br/><h2>What does the Code contain?</h2>
        <p>Though not expressedly a part of the 54 titles, the website of the House of Representatives aptly lists an index of organic laws, which represent the foundational statues 
            that established governance of United States territories. These key items are the foundation on which the United States Code is built:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Declaration of Independence - 1776</li>
            <li>Articles of Confederation - 1777</li>
            <li>Declaration of Independence - 1776</li>
            <li> Ordinance of 1787: The Northwest Territorial Government</li>
            <li>Constitution of the United States</li>
            <li>Analytical Index to the Constitution of the United States</li>

        </ul>
        <p>These additional Organic Laws are embedded within the United States Code.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>statutory notes</li>
            <li>multiple sets of court regulations</li>
            <li>certain presidential documents:</li>
            <ol>
            <li>Ordinance of 1787: The Northwest Territorial Government</li>
            <li>Constitution of the United States</li>
            <li>Analytical Index to the Constitution of the United States</li></ol></ul>
        <p>You may have noticed that the editorial styles are not uniform throughout the Code. This is because there have been many changes to way things are done.
            The Four common types of changes:<br/>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>section designation</li>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>bracketed citations</li>
            <li>translation</li></ul>
        <p>Each title of the Code is subcategorized into smaller compartments such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>subtitles</li>
            <li>chapters</li>
            <li>subchapters</li>
            <li>parts</li>
            <li>subparts</li>
            <li>sections</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
        <br/><h2>Positive Law</h2>
        <p>Within the USC, positive law refers to the titles that themselves serve as source for the law.
        On the contrary, non-positive laws almost always refer to a separate source credit as their base law. Half of the 54 titles of the United States Code have been enacted into what is known as positive law.
        The distinction is legally relevant, as a non-positive law can be rebutted by pointing out the discrepancies between the title and the underlying statute. 
        Should ambiguities or inconsistencies arise from duplication, they are resolved through positive law codification. 
        Positive law codification additionally serves as a way to correct technical, grammatical, or typographical errors, as well as misspellings or defective cross references. 
        Though technical changes are made to the law, the text is not changed so that the meaning of the law is altered. 

        These are titles:</br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 - General Provisions</li>
            <li>3 - The President</li>
            <li>4 - Flag And Seal, Seat Of Government, And The States</li>
            <li>5 - Government Organization And Employees</li>
            <li>9 - Arbitration</li>
            <li>10 - Armed Forces</li>
            <li>11 - Bankruptcy</li>
            <li>13 - Census</li>

            <li>35 - Patents</li>

            <li>49 - Transportation</li>
            <li>51 - National And Commercial Space Programs</li>
            <li>54 - National Park Service And Related Programs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every codification bill is accompanied by an explanation of the bill. This explanation consists of: source credit tables, which provide the source material for the respective provisions; 
            and revision notes, which are found beneath the source credit table and are written specifically for the technical revisions that require further explanation. Upon finalization of the codification and 
            explanation bills, they are presented to and introduced by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives. The aforementioned explanation bill is then rewritten into a report as an addendum 
            to the bill.
